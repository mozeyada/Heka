## Immediate Action Plan

As Project Manager, I'm proceeding with the following while you review:

### Phase 1: Pre-Development (Weeks 1-2) 🔄 **STARTING NOW**

#### Week 1: Design & Specification
1. **Create UI/UX Wireframes** (I'll do this)
   - Onboarding flow (individual accounts → couple linking)
   - Argument resolution flow
   - Check-ins & goals (retention features)
   - Dashboard design
   - Mobile-responsive layouts

2. **Finalize Technical Specifications** (I'll do this)
   - API endpoint definitions
   - Database schema finalization
   - AI prompt templates
   - Integration points documentation

3. **Legal Documentation Drafts** (I'll create initial drafts)
   - Privacy Policy template
   - Terms of Service template
   - Disclaimers text
   - *Then you engage lawyer for review*

#### Week 2: Development Preparation
1. **Set Up Development Environment** (I'll do this)
   - GitHub repository structure
   - Project scaffolding
   - CI/CD pipeline setup
   - Development tooling

2. **Create Detailed User Stories** (I'll do this)
   - Break down MVP features into actionable tasks
   - Acceptance criteria
   - Technical implementation notes

### Phase 2: MVP Development (Weeks 3-16)

**Sprint 1-6:** Execute development plan as outlined in PROJECT_PLAN.md

## What I Need From You (Stakeholder)

### Quick Decisions Needed:

1. **MVP Retention Features - Final Approval**
   - I recommend including basic check-ins and goal setting in MVP
   - **Question:** Do you agree with MVP_SCOPE.md? Any changes?

2. **Budget/Resources**
   - Do you have development resources ready, or should I proceed with solo development plan?
   - **Question:** What's your budget/timeline expectation?

3. **Legal Counsel**
   - Should I create draft legal documents first, or do you want to engage lawyer immediately?
   - **Recommendation:** I create drafts first (saves lawyer time/money)

4. **Branding**
   - Do you have logo/brand colors, or should I propose initial design direction?
   - **Recommendation:** Basic branding for MVP, refine later
