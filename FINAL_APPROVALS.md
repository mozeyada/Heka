## ✅ Approved Decisions Summary

### 1. AI Model Selection 🤖
**Decision:** **Hybrid Approach - Option C**

**Strategy:**
- **MVP/Beta Phase:** Start with **OpenAI GPT-4**
  - Best quality for proving value proposition
  - Build user trust with excellent insights
  - Costs manageable at beta scale (50-100 users)

- **Beta Testing Phase:** Test **Google Gemini 2.5 Flash** in parallel
  - Side-by-side quality comparison
  - Test with real user arguments
  - Measure cost savings potential

- **Post-Beta Decision:** Choose based on results
  - If Gemini quality acceptable: Migrate for cost savings
  - If GPT-4 essential: Keep and optimize
  - Optional: Tier by subscription (Gemini for Basic, GPT-4 for Premium)

**Expected Costs:**
- Beta (100 users, 5 args each): GPT-4 = $50-250/month
- At scale (1,000 users): Gemini could save $200-1,200/month

### 2. Free Tier Structure 🆓
**Decision:** **7-Day Trial with Usage Limit - Option C**

**Structure:**
- ✅ **7-day free trial**
- ✅ **5 argument resolution limit** during trial
- ✅ **No credit card required**
- ✅ Access to all features: check-ins, goals, full mediation

**Rationale:**
- Time to experience retention features (check-ins are weekly)
- Cost control (5 arguments = ~$0.50-2.50 per user max)
- Clear upgrade path ("You've used 5 cases, upgrade for unlimited")
- Still demonstrates full value proposition

**Cost Impact:**
- At 100 beta users: ~$50-250/month (acceptable)
- Predictable costs, no surprises

### 5. Trial Usage Limits 📊
**Decision:** **Soft Limit: 5 Arguments - Option B**

**Implementation:**
- Pre-set limit: 5 argument resolutions during 7-day trial
- Cost control from day 1
- Clear messaging: "You've used 5 of 5 free argument resolutions"
- Upgrade prompt: "Upgrade for unlimited argument resolutions + ongoing relationship support"

**User Experience:**
- Still demonstrates value (5 arguments is plenty)
- Encourages upgrade for unlimited access
- Clear boundaries, no confusion
